___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 26 at 11:36 PM`\
Hello?

@Sharks


___Autumn___ — `May 26 at 11:44 PM`\
We received evidence that you may have been suggestive and lewd in DMs with an underage user


___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 26 at 11:44 PM`\
That is correct. I admit it.

I had roleplays with that user.


___CutesiKaGor___ — `May 26 at 11:45 PM`\
…


___Autumn___ — `May 26 at 11:45 PM`\
Were you aware before the DMs started that they were underage?


___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 26 at 11:45 PM`\
I was aware.

I tried to act like a silly drunk person, and it may have given suggestive impression.


___Autumn___ — `May 26 at 11:47 PM`\
You were saying to "kick my balls"

Id say that goes beyond a "silly drunk person"


___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 26 at 11:48 PM`\
Before that, the user did "kicks balls"

And I was talking about the user kicking balls in that context of roleplay.


___Autumn___ — `May 26 at 11:50 PM`\
You were also saying "I was gonna ... kiss you" and were discussing their saliva

___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 26 at 11:50 PM`\
That is also correct.

___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 26 at 11:51 PM` - *Reply to ___OhNull 오늘___ "I was aware"*\
However, I was not aware that the user was disturbed with the roleplay, as the user continued to respond and resumed 
roleplaying.


___Autumn___ — `May 26 at 11:52 PM`\
Did you need to mention that your "dick [was] hard" though?

___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 26 at 11:52 PM`\
That was after the "kicking in the balls" was mentioned.


___Autumn___ — `May 26 at 11:53 PM`\
But you knew they were underage?


___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 26 at 11:54 PM`\
Yes. I would like to clarify that I am aware that pedophilia is by no means good and I am aware that those statements 
are inappropriate.


___Autumn___ — `May 26 at 11:55 PM`\
Then why do it?


___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 26 at 11:56 PM` - *Edited*\
The user and I used to do roleplays, sometimes wholesome, sometimes intimate in terms of context. I do not and have not 
had any romantic or sexual feelings for the user and those were mostly for fun, at least for me.


___Autumn___ — `May 26 at 11:57 PM`\
"sometimes intimate"?


___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 26 at 11:58 PM`\
Yes, such as giving pets and the user resting on my character in terms of roleplaying.


___Autumn___ — `May 26 at 11:58 PM`\
You mentioned your dick in their dms

This is by no means appropriate for those dms


___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 26 at 11:59 PM`\
I am aware and I agree.


___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 26 at 11:59 PM` - *Edited*\
The user mentioned kicking my balls in dm before that happened as well. 


___Autumn___ — `May 27 at 12:00 AM`\
That doesnt mean you get to mention your dick being hard now as a result of that


___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 27 at 12:01 AM` - *Edited*\
I acknowledge. I skipped to assumptions that the user would be ok with such topic. 


___Autumn___ — `May 27 at 12:02 AM`\
why?

you're considerably older than they are


___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 27 at 12:05 AM`\
I assumed the user would be ok with a roleplay that contains a "silly drunk" character; I reckoned the user was a close friend, as the user was fine with talking about sexualities, depressions, and some life stories of each other.


___Autumn___ — `May 27 at 12:05 AM`\
so they told you they're ace then


***OhNull 오늘*** — `May 27 at 12:05 AM` - *Edited*\
And I am aware that does not justify talking about such topics to a younger person. 

Yes.


___Autumn___ — `May 27 at 12:06 AM`\
Then why were you talking about that?


___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 27 at 12:07 AM`\
It was a roleplay and I am by no means a pedophile.


___Mykii___ — `May 27 at 12:07 AM`\
Can I add something


___Autumn___ — `May 27 at 12:07 AM`\
Roleplay does not excuse lewd rp

___Autumn___ — `May 27 at 12:07 AM` - *Reply to ___Mykii___ "Can I add something"*\
go ahead


___Mykii___ — `May 27 at 12:09 AM`\
I just came back from my slumber and will be returning back, but I do not care if you were "rping sometimes wholesome, 
sometimes intimate" and you KNEW it was a minor, and you continued

If you sent suggestive msg or any kind of ||lewd|| to a minor, that's disturbing and uncalled


___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 27 at 12:11 AM`\
I understand and I would like to apologize.


___Mykii___ — `May 27 at 12:11 AM`\
You shouldnt even be given a chance to explain, it really is uncomfortable and that is on your fault, and you say you 
aren't a pedo then stop rping towards minors, are you actually serious

I do not tolerate this at all


___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 27 at 12:11 AM`\
I will not.


___CutesiKaGor___ — `May 27 at 12:12 AM` - *Edited*\
I’d like to add that even if the minor “goes along with it”, they may not fully understand what’s going on/what’s wrong 
about it. it’s your responsibility as the adult to know it’s wrong and to not initiate anything lewd with them. 


___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 27 at 12:13 AM`\
I understand.


___Autumn___ — `May 27 at 12:15 AM`\
one final question

Why block them after the fact?


___OhNull 오늘___ — `May 27 at 12:17 AM`\
I assumed that the user would not want to talk to me anymore after being banned from a server. As a proof not to disturb
them anymore, I blocked them to give them a distance.
