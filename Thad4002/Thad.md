# Introduction

Thad is a user who practically stalked me on all my acccounts. They followed me on every platform, and send me messages 
on a regular basis. The entire ordeal ended in me blocking them and banning them from every server I could for creeping 
me the fuck out.

## "Apology"

After blocking Thad on Twitter, they came to my discord dms to Apologize saying:
> I am very sorry for what happened
> 
![Thad4002 - I am very sorry for what happened](ApologyOG.png)

I opted to ignore the message because they failed to acknowledge the fact that they were responsible for their own 
actions, and that they were the cause of any of this.

They later edited the message to say
>I am very sorry for what i did.
> 
![Thad4002 - I am very sorry for what I did](ApologyEdited.png)

I continued to ignore their message and not respond, because im not going to accept an apology from someone who just 
sucker punched me.

Despite not accepting, they sent me a message asking me, I shit you not dear reader,:
> What is your favorite color?
